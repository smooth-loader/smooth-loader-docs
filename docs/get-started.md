# Documentation

## Introduction
Smooth Loader enables seamless lazy loading of images and background images. Lazy Loading postpones the loading of images that aren't immediately visible on the page. Images outside the user's viewport are loaded only when the user scrolls and they come into view. If the user doesn't scroll, those images are never loaded, saving bandwidth and improving page performance.

This package is an essential tool for any website with multiple images, offering high configurability and performance. Smooth Loader is arguably the best lazy loading package on NPM, tailored to fit your needs.
